# generators and their purposes: a list

##Generator1
1 : "addition of 2 power of 2 in decimal", "result in decimal" , double possible, biggest number always first
1_1  "additions of  2 powers of 2, both from 1 to 16 in decimal" , "results in decimal"
1_2  "additions of 2 powers of 2, both from 1 to 32 in decimal" , "results in decimal"
1_3  "additions of 2 powers of 2, both from 1 to 64 in decimal" , "results in decimal"
1_4  "additions of 2 powers of 2, both from 1 to 128 in decimal" , "results in decimal"
##generator2
2: reverse of 1 : "result - any of the two operands" , "other operand"
2_1 
2_2
2_3
2_4
##generator3
3: "8 bits binary, only one bit set to 1" , "same number in decimal", and reverse
3_1 bit set to one is in the last nibble
3_2 bit set to one is anywhere
3_3 reverse of 3_1
3_4 reverse of 3_2 

4: combination of 1,2,3: " binary with 2 bits set to one", "same number in decimal"
