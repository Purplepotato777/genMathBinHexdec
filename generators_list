# generators and their purposes: a list

##Generator1
1 : question:"addition of 2 power of 2 in decimal", answer:"result in decimal" , double possible, biggest number always first
1_1  "additions of  2 powers of 2, both from 1 to 16 in decimal" , "results in decimal"
1_2  "additions of 2 powers of 2, both from 1 to 32 in decimal" , "results in decimal"
1_3  "additions of 2 powers of 2, both from 1 to 64 in decimal" , "results in decimal"
1_4  "additions of 2 powers of 2, both from 1 to 128 in decimal" , "results in decimal"
##generator2
2: reverse of generator 1, with similar ranges per sublevel : question : "sum of 2 power of 2 - a power of 2" , answer:"a power of 2" 
2_1 
2_2
2_3
2_4
##generator3
3: "8 bits binary, only one bit set to 1" , "same number in decimal", 
3_1 bit set to one is in the right nibble
3_2 bit set to one is in the left nibble
3_3 bit set to one is anywhere

## generator4
4: reverse of 3 ,  with similar ranges
4_1
4_2
4_3



5: combination of 1,2,3: " binary with 2 bits set to one", "same number in decimal"

5: no generator for this level, port-services written manually # temporary location
